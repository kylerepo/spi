# üîß COMPLETE FIX FOR ALL ISSUES

## Current Problems

Based on your screenshots, you have 3 critical errors:

1. ‚ùå **"Upload failed: Failed to get upload URL"** - Photo upload fails
2. ‚ùå **"Profile Completion Failed: The string did not match the expected pattern"** - Profile can't be completed  
3. ‚ùå **"Database error saving new user"** - Can't sign up new users

## Root Causes

All these issues stem from **3 configuration problems**:
