# Deployment Fix - Schema Export Issue

## Issue
Build was failing with error:
```
"insertCommunityPostSchema" is not exported by "shared/schema.ts"
```

## Root Cause
When I rewrote the `shared/schema.ts` file to add comprehensive Supabase types, I didn't include some types that the frontend was already using:
- `InsertCommunityPost`
- `insertCommunityPostSchema`
- `Match`
- `ProfileLike`
- `Conversation`
- `Message`

## Solution
Added the missing type exports to `/app/shared/schema.ts`:

```typescript
// Community Post (for IsoPage)
export interface InsertCommunityPost {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  category: string;
  isAnonymous: boolean;
}

export const insertCommunityPostSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(200),
  content: z.string().min(1).max(2000),
  category: z.string().min(1),
  isAnonymous: z.boolean(),
});

// Matches & Messaging (for frontend compatibility)
export interface Match {
  id: string;
  user1_id: string;
  user2_id: string;
  matched_at: string;
  created_at: string;
}

export interface ProfileLike {
  id: string;
  liker_id: string;
  liked_id: string;
  created_at: string;
}

export interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  match_id: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

export interface Message {
  id: string;
  conversation_id: string;
  sender_id: string;
  content: string;
  type: 'text' | 'image' | 'emoji';
  is_read: boolean;
  created_at: string;
}
```

## Build Status
✅ **Build now successful**

```bash
npm run build
# Output:
✓ 1869 modules transformed.
✓ built in 8.04s
```

## PostCSS Warning
The PostCSS warning is just a deprecation notice and doesn't affect the build:
```
A PostCSS plugin did not pass the `from` option to `postcss.parse`
```
This is a known issue with some PostCSS plugins and can be safely ignored. The build completes successfully.

## Files Modified
- `/app/shared/schema.ts` - Added missing type exports

## Verification
Run the build command to verify:
```bash
npm run build
```

Should output:
```
✓ built in ~8s
```

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel or any other platform. All TypeScript types are properly exported and the build completes successfully.
